# Horiseon-Refactoring

## Scope of the Project
I was tasked with refactoring the code for Horiseon's website to bring it up to today's accessibility standards. This in turn would also optimize the website for search engines. To accomplish this the code needed semantic HTML elements that would accurately break down the page into a logical structure.

## Method
In the original HTML, there was on overuse of the div tag. I went through the code and replaced the div tags with fitting HTML tags. The images were also lacking alt attributes, which are needed to achieve accessibility standards. I also changed the title from website to the name of the company, Horiseon Marketing.

The CSS file contained certain sections that were redundant. They had multiple elements styled the same way, but in separate classes, so they had to write out styling for each one. I styled them under the same selector to consolidate the CSS.
